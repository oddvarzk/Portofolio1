                    This project was our last big one that we had at the end of our first Semester, was very fun to do,
                    was very satisfied with the entirety of the site and how it looks. Wanted to keep the site looking as
                    proffesional as possible, with a high accessibility onto the entire site and a alot of info on getting around
                    at the Museum.

                    This is one of the first website projects i've ever done, completed with only HTML/CSS and a prototype
                    using Figma to outline and draw out how i wanted the site to look. Not my finest work but very valid as my
                    first website.

                    This was the last site that we made for the 2nd semester, and the completion of our first year. The site is not
                    100% complete, but with a few tweaks and cleaning up it's nearly finished.
